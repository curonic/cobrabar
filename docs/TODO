done! make applicationbutton properties standard for placesbutton & disksbuttons & pins
done! fix applicationbutton padding
done! tooltips not working >>> mousearea overrides buttons. rewrite buttons as items anyway
done! move buttons & placebuttons in the same class (theming should be enough to separate the two)
done! add text alignment for buttons
done! add icons for places
done! add auto reload on theme changed
done! add shadow for main window (kinda, semi-translucent border)
done! something about pins (they are too squeezed in the corner)
done! more style properties (button colors, gradients, noise etc...)
done! get rid of javascripts
done! make a theming engine
