+ add ApplicationLaunch busy indicator (QProcess stuff?)
+ add "smart popup" for calendar
+ add individual corner radius
+ add analog clock option
+ add auto reload on theme changed
+ add more styles
+ add icons for places
+ add text alignment for buttons
+ move buttons & placebuttons in the same class (theming should be enough to separate the two)
+ tooltips not working >>> mousearea overrides buttons. rewrite buttons as items anyway
+ turn strings "10px" & "10pt" into <int>10
+ change image-opacity to background-image-opacity maybe???
+ fix applicationbutton padding
+ make applicationbutton properties standard for placesbutton & disksbuttons & pins

done! more style properties (button colors, gradients, noise etc...)
done! get rid of javascripts
done! make a theming engine
